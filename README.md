# Sink-a-Startup (Learning Project)

This project is part of my journey to learn **core Java fundamentals**.

The goal of this project is to practice:
- Basic Java syntax
- Classes and objects
- Method calls and object interaction
- Simple program flow and responsibility separation

## About this project

This project is **adapted from exercises in the book _Head First Java_**.
The logic and idea are inspired by the book and are used **purely for learning purposes**.

The focus here is not originality, but understanding:
- How Java programs are structured
- How multiple classes work together
- How state changes through method calls

## Additional learning goals

Alongside Java, I am also using this project to:
- Learn **basic Git and GitHub workflows**
- Practice command-line Git operations
- Understand how to push a project to a remote repository cleanly

## Scope

- This is a **learning project**, not a production application
- No frameworks, build tools, or advanced patterns are used
- The code is intentionally simple and instructional

## Notes

This repository exists to track learning progress and build correct habits.
